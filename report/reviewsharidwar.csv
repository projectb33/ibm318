I have travel to various places & always look for the best property to stay. After doing the research for many days I did the booking with Fortune Haridwar. This is one of the best property in Haridwar to stay with.  All hotel staffs are very supportive and are always ready to help .We had our lunch at the hotel and trust me the food was amazingly good. We could not able to eat breakfast as we left at around 04:00 in the morning from the hotel and we requested for packed breakfast which was provided and was really good. Whenever I will visit Haridwar I will stay with this hotel only. Thank you Fortune Park team members for making our trip as a memorable.,Nickson Dave,/Profile/davesonholi,50
"Went for my grandfather Barkhi with family of 20. When you enter the hotel, there is absolute negativity with no hotel staff welcoming or smiling at you. Very Poor and slow check in procedure. We had to go to Ghat for rituals so asked hotel to pack breakfast for 10 people. They packed 10 Puri for 15 people. Female members who went for breakfast at 10.30 were denied breakfast. We do understand that live counters can be denied but even normal breakfast was denied. Informed hotel 30 min before about checkout but after coming on reception they took another 30 min to finish check out formalities. This hotel has a unique rule that i have not seen anywhere in the world - They will literally wait for each room card to be submitted back before they can raise your bill. Overall bad",chandan2015,/Profile/chandan2015,10

"While this property was supposed to be in Haridwar, it was quite far from the town. So, it seemed like the place was in the middle of nowhere. And from the outside, the building looked quite odd. There was a shopping mall adjacent to this hotel, and the rooms on one side of the building had nothing but the walls of this adjoining mall, for a view. This definitely was odd. The gym hardly had any equipments - not sure if one could even call it functional. The service, in general, was slow, but manageable.  Above being said, the hotel was all right for a short layover. The rooms were clean, nicely designed and well-equipped. The breakfast spread was good, but some of the items were stale - pretty much their entire selection of pastries were inedible.   Despite a few shortcomings,",Vijayk1981,/Profile/Vijayk1981,40

"Fortune Park hotel in Haridwar is located about 10 km from Har Ki Pauri and could be a time consuming ride due to narrow roads and traffic. It is located in a commercial compound housing a mall which hasn’t seen any occupants (seemed like that). Location is quite a distance away from shops and restaurants, so kind of isolated.   Room is fairly standard for a hotel of this class and is neat and comfortable. Linen is good, bathrooms are fine and service is courteous. No reason for any complaints.   Their buffet dinner was the standout in my experience. Dinner and breakfast were included in the tariff plan we chose. Dinner was awesome with a very good spread of chat, salads, soups, paneer, aloo gobhi, dal, rice, veg biryani, noodles and over 10 different desserts.

"I went to this hotel few weeks back. The hotel is a very good hotel with nice room size. The staffs were friendly and respectful. The dinning options is very nice but can be improved by introducing few more Indian dishes in the buffet. Overall it was a very pleasant experience.  But this hotel doesnt have any concierge service. The hotel is having connection with a car rent company who provides horrible cars with high price. Also in Uttarakhand, getting a good vehicle for site seeing is very difficult. Hence I recommend that if you travel to this hotel, ensure you book a vehicle from outside company prior to check in. ",souravp101,/Profile/souravp101,40

The chef cooks amazing food be it the breakfast menu or lunch/dinner.  2) The rooms are spacious , very nice lighting and ambiance, sound proof, perfect temperature controls. 3) The staff at the hotel is highly mannered, courteous, proactive. I have frequent interactions with Jagjit and Aditya and I am delighted always.  4) Nice vehicle parking is available outside. Its highly safe.

"Recently we happened to stay at Fortune Park, Haridwar as a group of two families. The hotel is superb though little away from the city area. The prices were much reasonable with the quality of rooms and room amenities are concerned.  Location ======== As I mentioned above, the location may be little far from the main city but it provided a good space and open areas unlike hotels located in crowded and noisy small lanes and more expensive than this one. The nearest Airport is Dehradoon located around 40 Kms away from the hotel having a driving distance of around an hour.

Before booking it most reviews said 10/15 minutes- but this is misleading. We had organised a car and driver for the entire trip so that was okay with us, otherwise we would have struggled with the transportation (although I am not sure if the hotel would have been able to organise something or not).

"Booked a suite for 3 people, here is my experience--  - Opted for the property given that this was showing up amongst the top 15-20 hotels in Haridwar - Staff was very pushy and keen to get us out even before we checked-in, 'what time will you check-out' was the buzz from the front desk to the room-service boys! Really bad.  - Requested for an extra bed, paid 1K INR plus taxes only to realize that they make the convertible sofa into the extra bed, and trust me, you can't sleep on it because it has an uneven surface. Ended up with a severe back pain and stiffness - Passage near my suite, 511 was full of leftovers, dirty plates and cutlery- despite informing the hotel staff, these were not cleaned/ cleared up for over 24 hours - Buffet spread is very average, had to keep asking",Shekhz,/Profile/Shekhz,20
